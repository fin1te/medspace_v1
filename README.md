##My First Android app, Medspace - Medical record maintenance app's First public build
---
This app MedSpace is what i made for my 3rd Semester's project, and i wish 
to continue this project further as a personal hobby, while i learn more 
about coding and Android Studio. This Project's first iteration was made
somewhere in late 2020 by me (Fin1te) with the help of a friend from 
Medical background (For the Algorithm and Flow of the app). As of Early
2021 only we two are involved in the Development of this App. 
---
More people may join this project in future if i seem it necessary, as we
intend to make further versions of this app as i learn more about data 
structures and algorithm, as well as Android Studio.

This project is by no means under any Github Licenses or Open Sources
(Not yet atleast). If you want to contribute to this project, get in touch
with me with your idea by creating an issue in this Repository.
