This app MedSpace is what i made for my 3rd Semester's project, and i wish 
to continue this project further as a personal hobby, while i learn more 
about coding and Android Studio. This Project's first iteration was made
somewhere in late 2020 by me (Fin1te) with the help of a friend from 
Medical background (For the Algorithm and Flow of the app). As of Early
2021 only we two are involved in the Development of this App. 
---
More people may join this project in future if i seem it necessary, as we
intend to make further versions of this app as i learn more about data 
structures and algorithm, as well as Android Studio.
